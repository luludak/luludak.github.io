        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
          My name is Nikolaos (Nick) and I am an AI Testing Researcher at the University of Edinburgh.<br />
          Recently, I obtained my Ph.D. in Informatics from the same institution.
          Previously, I was employed at Oracle Labs, Workable, Accenture and the Institute of
          Computer Science - FORTH, actively working on numerous projects, using state-of-the-art technologies
          and principles, both as researcher and software engineer.
          I am also a co-founder at Carbon Glance, a startup building a SaaS related to carbon
          regulations.<br />
          In addition to my Ph.D. studies, I hold an M.Sc. and a B.Sc. from the Computer Science Department of
          the University of Crete, focused on the fields of Software Engineering, Information Systems and Human-Computer
          Interaction.
          For me, studying Computer Science and working in this fascinating field is a dream fulfilled
          and that I am happy to constantly learn more and work with enthusiasm and passion and produce excellent and
          impactful results.
